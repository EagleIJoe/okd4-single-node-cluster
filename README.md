Building an OKD4 cluster with minimal resources

### Work In Progress.  Documentation is incomplete.  Check back often.

This tutorial will guide you through deploying an OKD 4.4 cluster that is as minimal as possible.  It will consist of one node which is both master and worker.

You will need a CentOS 7.6 linux host with 2 cores and at least 32GB of RAM.

Follow the guide here: [OKD 4.4 Single Node Cluster](https://cgruver.github.io/okd4-single-node-cluster/)

Much of the material for this minimal cluster is borrowed from my other OKD 4.4 tutorial.  If you are interested in building a production like OKD 4.4 cluster, then check it out here: [OKD 4.4 Lab](https://cgruver.github.io/okd4-upi-lab-setup/)
